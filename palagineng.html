                In the summer of 2000, several airborne soldiers were wounded in combat in a mountainous region of Chechnya. The enemy fired automatic weapons and several grenade launchers at Palagin's Mi-8 helicopter, which had just arrived. Nevertheless, the coordinated work of the crew made it possible to quickly load the wounded and the commander's skill allowed the heavy vehicle to escape from the fire. All of the wounded were safely transported to the base of the Russian forces.

                In June 2002, near the village of Shali, superior insurgent forces drove a group of 16 Russian reconnaissance men into a minefield, and three of the men were seriously wounded by explosions. When Sergei Palagin, commander of the helicopter squadron, arrived at the site of the battle under enemy fire, he discovered that the group was in the woods. The commander decided to go down, breaking the branches of the trees with the fuselage of the helicopter. The vehicle hovered over the abyss for 17 minutes. In the end, the evacuation was completed.

                Palagin's Mi-8 MTV-2 had its own name "Bratishka", given to it by the soldiers whom the helicopter's experienced crew often rescued in a critical situation. There was an opinion that the helicopter and crew were "conspired" because the machine often came out of combat without much damage, and the crew did not suffer any losses during their service. Because of this, the presence of the Palagin crew on the battlefield or its participation in various operations raised the morale of soldiers and had a generally beneficial effect.
